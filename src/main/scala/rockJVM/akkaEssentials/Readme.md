# Rock The JVM: Akka Essentials

Akka is a multithreading framework for the JVM that enables us to build powerful reactive, concurrent, and distributed applications more easily. 
Akka is based on Actors, which are objects which we can only interact with via messages. Actors have the following properties:
- every interaction happens via messaging
- messages are asynchronous
- we can't directly access the Actor object


## Actors Basic
An Actor implementation, looks like this 

```scala
import akka.actor.Actor

class SimpleActor extends Actor {
     override def receive: Receive = {
         case number: Int => println(s"[$self]: I have received a number: $number")
         case Some(content) => println(s"[$self]: I have received a special message: $content")
         case "self" => println(s"[$self]: My self is ${self}")
         case message: String => println(s"[$self]: I have received from ${sender().path} message: $message")
     }
 }
```

`Receive` is a type definition for `PartialFunction[Any, Unit]`. To initialize and communicate with an Actor
do something like:

Note, that we never directly access actors, so to communicate with an actor, we create an `ActorRef` and we 
interact with this. We never initialize and access the fields of an actor.

```scala
import akka.actor.{ActorRef, ActorSystem, Props}

val system = ActorSystem("actorCapabilitiesDemo")
val simpleActor: ActorRef = system.actorOf(Props[SimpleActor], "simpleActor")
simpleActor ! "hello, Actor"
simpleActor ! 42
simpleActor ! Some("this is special")
```
The messages can be of Any type **BUT** they must be:
- IMMUTABLE
- SERIALIZABLE

*Usually we communicate with Actors via case classes/objects*

// TODO add actorSelection

To stop an Actor, we can send him one of two special messages: 
- PoisonPill
- Kill

`PoisonPill` will smoothly stop an Actor by calling `context.stop`, while `Kill` will brutally kill him by
throwing a `AkkaKillExceptions`.
```scala
import akka.actor.{Kill, PoisonPill}
simpleActor1 ! Kill
simpleActor2 ! PoisonPill
```
Any Actor can watch another Actor using `context.watch(ref)`. This way, if the watched actor dies, the watcher will
receive the special message `Terminated(ref)` 

## Actors Life-Cycle

Actors can be 
 - started: create a new ActorRef with a UUID at a given path
 - suspended: the ActorRef will enqueue but **NOT** process any new messages
 - resumed: the ActorRef will continue process the enqueued messages
 - restarted: restarts an actor by destroying its internal state (this can happen by an exception). This occurs by doing the following steps:
   - suspend
   - swap actor instance (preRestart, replace with new instance, and finally calls postRestart)
   - resume
   
 - stop: stops an ActorRef. All watchers of the ref will receive `Terminated(ref)` message

*Note, that when a parent is being restarted, all of its children get stopped!*

Classic actors have methods `preStart`, `preRestart`, `postRestart` and `postStop` that can be overridden to act on changes to 
the actorâ€™s lifecycle.


## Supervision Strategy

Akka prides itself about fault tolerance! Parent actors decide how to handle a child failure. 

When an actor fails:
- suspends all of its children 
- sends a special message to its parent

The parent can decide to:
- resume the actor
- fail and escalate the failure to its parent

We can do this by overriding the `supervisorStrategy`. This way we can define the behaviour of the 
spawning children and ensure fault-tolerance and self-healing.

```scala
override val supervisorStrategy: OneForOneStrategy = OneForOneStrategy(){
    case _: NullPointerException => akka.actor.SupervisorStrategy.Restart
    case _: IllegalArgumentException => akka.actor.SupervisorStrategy.Stop
    case _: RuntimeException => akka.actor.SupervisorStrategy.Resume
    case _: Exception => akka.actor.SupervisorStrategy.Escalate
}
```

## Scheduler & Timers

Akka enables us to schedule tasks to run once or periodically, after a predefined period of time. 
We do this using `system.scheduler.scheduleOnce` or `system.scheduler.schedule`, which both returns a 
`Cancelable` enabling us to cancel the task if we want. See example:

```scala
 // schedule job to run once after 1 second
 system.scheduler.scheduleOnce(1 second){
     simpleActor ! "Start"
 }(system.dispatcher)

 // schedule job to run repeatedly every 2 seconds, after 1 second
 val routine = system.scheduler.schedule(1 second, 2 second){
     simpleActor ! "HeartBeat"
 }(system.dispatcher)

 // cancel repeated scheduler
 system.scheduler.scheduleOnce(5 second){
     routine.cancel()
 }(system.dispatcher)
```
We can also schedule jobs to run within an Actor, by implementing a `Timers`. With `Timers`, we can schedule 
jobs to run once (by sending messages), to run repeatedly and to cancel them, very similar as `system.schedule`
See example:

```scala
case object TimerKey
case object Start
case object Stop
case object Reminder
case object Pause
class TimerBasedHeartbeatActor extends Actor with ActorLogging with Timers {
  // send message to myself after 500ms
  timers.startSingleTimer(TimerKey, Start, 500 millis)

  override def receive: Receive = {
      case Start =>
          log.info("Bootstrapping")
          // send repeatedly message Reminder to myself every 1s
          timers.startPeriodicTimer(TimerKey, Reminder, 1 second)
      case Reminder =>
          log.info("I am alive")
      case Pause =>
          log.info("I am stopping timer")
          // Stop specific Timer
          timers.cancel(TimerKey)
      case Stop =>
          log.info("I am stopping")
          context.stop(self)
  }
}
val timerActor = system.actorOf(Props[TimerBasedHeartbeatActor], "timerActor")

system.scheduler.scheduleOnce(6 second) {
  timerActor ! Stop
}(system.dispatcher)

system.scheduler.scheduleOnce(3 second) {
  timerActor ! Pause
}(system.dispatcher)

```
